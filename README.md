Jarvis Voice Assistant is a Python-based AI voice assistant designed to respond to spoken commands and perform real-world tasks. Inspired by assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, Jarvis provides hands-free control for daily tasks through speech recognition and text-to-speech technology.

Jarvis listens for the wake-word “Jarvis”, and once activated, it processes your voice commands to deliver fast responses. It can open popular websites such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn, making browsing seamless through voice control. The assistant can also play songs using a predefined music library, read real-time news headlines aloud, and answer general questions using AI.
